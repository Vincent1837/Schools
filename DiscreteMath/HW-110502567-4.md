# Discrete Mathematics Homework 4

## Section 8-3

**6 . How many operations are needed to multiply two $32 × 32$ matrices using the algorithm referred to in Example 5?**

**10 . Find $f(n)$ when $n = 2^k$, where $f$ satisfies the recurrence relation $f(n)=f(n/2)+1$ with $f(1)=1$.**

**In Exercises 29–33, assume that $f$ is an increasing function satisfying the recurrence relat ion $f(n) = af (n/b) + cn^d$, where $a ≥ 1$, $b$ is an integer greater than $1$, and $c$ and $d$ are positive real numbers. These exercises supply a proof of Theorem 2.**
> **29 . Show that if $a = b^d$ and $n$ is a power of $b$, then $f(n) = f(1)n^d + cn^d\log_bn$.**
