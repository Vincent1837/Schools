> $\sum\limits^n_{k=0}k^2 \binom{n}{k}:$ ***Choose a subset $A$ of $k$ elements form the set of $n$ elements, then choose arbitrary element from $A$ twice.***
> $n(n-1)2^{n-2} + n2^{n-1}:$ ***The two terms of it represent two cases: the chosen two elements are the same, and are different. The first term is saying that choose two different elements, and then choose any subset of the set of the rest $(n-2)$ elements to form $A$, and the second one is saying that choose it, and then choose any subset of the set of the rest $(n-1)$ elements to form $A$.***
