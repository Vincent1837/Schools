# Discrete Mathematics Homework 2

**8 . Find at least three different sequences beginning with the terms 3, 5, 7 whose terms are generated by a simple formula or rule.**

**14 . For  each  of  these  sequences  find  a  recurrence  relation satisfied by this sequence. ( The answers are not unique because  there  are  infinitely  many  different  recurrence relations satisfied by any sequence.)**
- (b) 
- (h) 

**16 . Find the solution to each of these recurrence relations with the given initial conditions. Use an iterative approach such as that used in Example 10.**
- (d) $a_n=2a_{n-1}-3, a_0=-1$

**34 . Compute each of these double sums.**
- $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{2}\sum\limits_{j=0}^{3}i^2j^3$

## Section 4-1

**14 . **
- (d) 

**34 . Show that if $a\equiv{b}(mod m)$**
**38 . Show that if $n$ is an integer then $n^2\equiv{0}$ or $1 (mod 4)$.**
